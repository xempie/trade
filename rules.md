## Technical Analysis Requirements

### 1. FVG and T3 Line Alignment
**Rule**: FVG side must align with T3 line direction
- ‚úÖ **Valid**: Bullish FVG with bullish T3 line
- ‚úÖ **Valid**: Bearish FVG with bearish T3 line  
- ‚ùå **Invalid**: FVG direction opposite to T3 line

### 2. Trend Age Assessment
**Rule**: Trade only new trends or trends that are not too old
- **New Trend Indicators**:
  - Fresh breakout from consolidation
  - Recent higher highs/lower lows formation
  - Strong momentum without exhaustion signs
- **Avoid**:
  - Extended trends showing exhaustion
  - Trends with multiple failed continuation attempts
  - Overextended price movements

### 3. Liquidity Analysis
**Rule**: Ensure no unused liquidity will interfere with the trade
- **Check for**:
  - Unfilled gaps in the direction of trade
  - Untested significant support/resistance levels
  - Pending orders clusters that might reverse price
- **Action**: Avoid trades where liquidity could disrupt the expected move

### 4. FVG Overlap Assessment
**Rule**: No opposite-side FVG should be overlapping
- **Before Entry**: Scan for conflicting FVGs
- **Overlapping FVGs** create:
  - Conflicting signals
  - Increased probability of choppy price action
  - Reduced edge in the trade

### 5. Proximity Analysis
**Rule**: No similar-side FVGs should be too close
- **Issue**: Close FVGs can create:
  - Reduced individual significance
  - Confused price reaction
  - Weakened trading signal
- **Solution**: Choose the strongest/most significant FVG

### 6. Multi-Timeframe FVG Check
**Rule**: Higher timeframes must not have opposing FVGs
- **Process**:
  1. Check same timeframe for conflicting FVGs
  2. Check higher timeframes (4H, Daily, Weekly)
  3. Ensure no opposing FVGs that could override your signal
- **Hierarchy**: Higher timeframe FVGs take precedence

## FVG Timing and Trend Position

### Optimal FVG Positions
**Same-Side FVGs** (Trading with trend):
- ‚úÖ **Beginning of trend**: Fresh momentum, highest probability
- ‚úÖ **Middle of trend**: Continuation pattern, good probability
- ‚ùå **End of trend**: Avoid - trend exhaustion likely

**Reverse-Side FVGs** (Counter-trend):
- ‚úÖ **End of trend only**: Potential reversal signal
- ‚ùå **Beginning/Middle**: Against primary momentum
